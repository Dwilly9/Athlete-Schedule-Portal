# Athlete Schedule Portal
This is the group project that will be submitted as the final for my Software Engineering course that I am currently enrolled in with Professor Brad Messner.

This application was made as a solution to the problem of scheduling events and viewing scheduled events for all athletic teams at Seton Hill University. While there are no plans to deploy this application, 4 out of the 5 members of the team (including myself) are athletes, and therefore we are passionate about developing this solution as it intertwines 2 different passions many of us share.

This application will have 2 versions on iOS and Web. This is the iOS version. It uses SwiftUI and a MongoDB Realm backend.

Everyone in our group are all responsible for developing different pieces of this application. I personally have been in charge of developing the backend of the application, as well as overseeing all database needs along with one other team member. I also am the project manager for this entire project.

Our team is not using GitHub for version control, however this repo is up-to-date with the latest version of the code.
